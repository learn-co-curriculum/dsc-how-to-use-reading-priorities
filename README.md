# How to Use Daily Reading Priorities

This page explains how to use the daily Reading Priorities pages that are shared throughout the program. Your instructor may also provide guidance that modifies these instructions. 

# Motivation

Our program is fast paced, and we want to help you focus your time on the activities that will best support your learning. The Canvas courses contain a lot of material - more than most students will be able to complete during the program. The Reading Priorities pages can help you make sure that you are learning the core concepts and skills on schedule so you stay on track throughout the program.

# Priority Levels

The Reading Priorities pages assign priority levels to readings to help you manage your time throughout the program. Priority levels help you think about when or whether to complete a reading if you don’t have enough time to complete all the readings for a given day. 

* Priority 1 readings cover core concepts and skills, so you should complete them the day they are assigned. This will ensure that you are prepared for the upcoming lectures and other activities. If you are unable to complete these readings on schedule, make sure to finish them the following day and/or reach out to your instructor for support.

* Priority 2 readings are important but not critical for your success in the program. Complete them the day they are assigned if you have time, but don’t worry if you are unable to. You can complete them later when you might have more time.

* Priority 3 readings provide additional practice or teach supplemental content that is not needed to succeed in the program. Complete these readings only after you have completed all previous Priority 1 or 2 readings.

# Adjusting the Schedule

The readings for each day are chosen to prepare you for the lectures that will be delivered that day or the following day. However, you should feel free to adjust your personal reading schedule as needed for your own learning. Some possible adjustments you might make: 

* If Monday’s readings cover material for a lecture that is happening on Tuesday afternoon, complete some of those readings on Tuesday morning instead.

* If you complete all of the readings for a day, go back and complete unfinished readings from prior days or get a head start on the next day’s readings.

* If you know you will need to be absent, complete readings ahead of schedule so you won’t be behind when you return.

If you have any questions about how best to adjust your reading schedule, reach out to your instructor.

# Cumulative Labs

There are a few Cumulative Labs in each Phase to help assess your progress in the program. If you can complete these labs, you are on track for success with the rest of the Phase and the upcoming Code Challenge. If you find yourself struggling, revisit the prior lessons relevant to the parts where you get stuck. If you are unable to complete one, please reach out for assistance. 

Complete the Cumulative Labs soon after you’ve participated in the lecture that covers the topic. Your instructor may also give you special instructions about when or how to complete the Cumulative Labs - hold off on doing them if your instructor has specific plans for when/how to do them.

# Summary

The Reading Priorities pages should help you manage your time through Phases 1-4. Most of your time in the program will be spent outside of live class sessions, so the quality of your learning experience will depend greatly on how you use that time. Your instructor will give some instructions for how to use your time. Follow their instructions, and then use these Reading Priorities pages to help decide how best to use any remaining unstructured time. If you ever have any questions about what you should be doing, reach out to your peers or your instructor.
